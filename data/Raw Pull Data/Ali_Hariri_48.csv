1015526769,Privacy Statement Updates September 2022,"GitHub is introducing non-essential cookies on web pages that market our products to businesses. These cookies will provide analytics to improve the site experience and personalize content and ads for enterprise users. This change is only on subdomains, like [resources.github.com](http://resources.github.com/), where GitHub markets products and services to enterprise customers.  [Github.com](https://github.com/) will continue to operate as-is.

This change updates the Privacy Statement based on this new activity.

These updates will go into effect after the 30-day notice and comment period, on September 1, 2022.

See [comment below](https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/582#issuecomment-1234458256) with clarifications and changes made at the end of the comment period.
[Comment on #582 Privacy Statement Updates September 2022](https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/582#issuecomment-1234458256)
We want to thank everyone for their review and feedback on the Privacy Statement Update. We appreciate and share your passion for developer privacy. GitHub remains committed to having the highest privacy standards and will continue to center the needs of developers in all of our platform decisions. We intend for this to be a minimally invasive change that will enable us to provide the best tools to our users. In response to your comments, we are providing the following changes and points of clarification:
DNT and self-help browser extensions
Commenters raised questions about our language on DNT and self-help browser extensions. We've pushed a [commit](https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/582/commits/4a61c4e2be67c12a1cc200ef3e804db400ce1426) that:
• Folds the existing DNT and browser extension information into a new section on disabling non-essential cookies.
• Specifies there will be a user setting to disable non-essential cookies and provides additional details to clarify which cookies will be used and for what reasons.
• Specifies that DNT will be honored on GitHub, and that if a DNT signal is sent, GitHub will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies, so that we do not have to rely on third parties honoring DNT.
• Browsers' built-in tracking protection has advanced significantly in recent years, so we've noted that configuring that built-in protection may block non-essential cookies.
• Separated mentions of browser extensions designed to block tracking, and extensions designed to block unwanted content with the effect of blocking tracking, for clarity, though using either alone or in combination may block non-essential cookies.
• Changed links with additional information on DNT and browser extensions to point to their respective Wikipedia articles for neutrality, currency, and to clarify that these are not GitHub products (though of course we're proud that many privacy protection tools are developed on GitHub).
Finally, some have asked why we’re explaining technical self-help tools. GitHub has a very broad user base, including new developers – and we want everyone to be informed about the scope of their options, including technical options.
Enterprise user experience
Commenters asked for clarification about how this change will impact the enterprise user experience. We are introducing cookies on GitHub’s Enterprise Marketing Pages (e.g. [resources.github.com](http://resources.github.com/)), not on Enterprise user accounts. We intend for this change to make it easier for our Marketing team to better understand the needs of users who are visiting Enterprise Marketing Pages and connect them with the solutions that will benefit them most.
Users who visit these pages will have the option to express their cookies preferences by navigating to the link in the footer of the page.
Stylistic change
Commenters have asked why ‘Personal Data’ was changed to ‘personal data’ in the Privacy Statement update. We made personal data lowercase because it is not a defined term in our Terms of Service, for consistency with “All capitalized terms have their definition in [GitHub’s Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service), unless otherwise noted here.” The stylistic change does not impact its definition.",True,582,https://api.github.com/repos/github/site-policy/pulls/582,https://github.com/github/site-policy/pull/582,closed,111,50,1,2,237,64,0,0,[],2022-08-02 19:36:34+00:00,2022-09-01 15:42:16+00:00,2577942.0,"29 days, 20:05:42","[{'comment_id': 936082589, 'comment_body': 'Is the change from ""Personal Data"" to ""personal data"" a stylistic change?\r\n\r\nI note that the paragraph above is still intact:\r\n\r\n> All capitalized terms have their definition in [GitHub’s Terms of Service](/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service), unless otherwise noted here.\r\n\r\nPresuming this capitalization change is unintentional, it has the unfortunate effect of decoupling ""Personal Data"" from the definition provided in the GitHub Terms of Service, which means that ""personal data"" is no longer as delineated there, but could well be anything.\r\n\r\nIf this is an intentional change, it would seem better made as a visible change to the Terms of Service.
