Hey @andrewtavis, here's one more giant PR again unfortunately ðŸ™ˆ 

The PR adds:
- Lists the installed keyboards
- Displays menu option to toggle between comma and period for keyboards
- Translates the preferences to the keyboard view controller on launching a particular language keyboard.

Regarding the problem I was facing about refreshing the list, it has been worked out in a very hacky manner for the moment. I will explain the problem better in the meeting tomorrow. The gist is that it works when we open the app on some other menu tab and then navigate to the `Settings` tab. This allows me to call the `viewWillAppear` method which takes care of the refresh. The refresh uses the Notification system. Publishes a notification whenever the value changes which is then handled by a function that is set to execute. This function calls the refresh on the child table views. 

I also tried to add a notification observer to only the dynamic data sections so that not all child tables are reloaded. This is done using an additional property `hasDynamicData` which accepts an enum value. Chose an enum since if we add more sections further that have dynamic data, handling it using a switch statement should be easier.

I plan on working on this in the background. But this issue was holding back from moving on to the next issues so I decided to push this unoptimised yet best working state. Do let me know if it is okay for now.

Hey @andrewtavis! Like I mentioned in our meeting last week, sorry for this clutter of a pull request. I promise the next pull requests will be atomic and specific in nature. I was extremely rusty with UIKit and needed a lot of refresher articles which really clumped the commits together beyond resolve. 

- This pull request adds a Tab bar navigation to the Scribe app. We can toggle between Installation, Settings, About sections.
- The Installation tab is just the older Scribe app screen. Will make changes to it as I get to their respective child issues.
- The Settings and About tab use a nested UITableView approach. They have their separate files to interpolate the tables on these screens.
  - A few of the older commits will basically show the older approach I was attempting where each section was a separate UITableView.
  - It required having multiple IBOutlet variables and also needed a ScrollView to be added manually. (Adding constraints to the ScrollView was a mess)
  - Nested table views allow us to have only a single table view and also helps with as the content scales or screen size reduces.
  - The custom cell components can be found in the `Components` folder.
- Necessary icons have been added to the Assets catalogue along with their dark mode versions.

Tested on devices iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone SE (3rd gen)

Hey @andrewtavis!

Here's the PR for the design fixes that were discussed in our last meeting. I hope I have covered everything. Do let me know if I missed anything. The changes include:
- Increasing separation between sections as well as the first section and title.
- Changing tab bar icon colour to be `linkBlue` so that it is inverse of the current theme (dark or light mode).
- Increased the size of the settings icon a little.

Hey @andrewtavis, here's one more giant PR again unfortunately ðŸ™ˆ 

The PR adds:
- Lists the installed keyboards
- Displays menu option to toggle between comma and period for keyboards
- Translates the preferences to the keyboard view controller on launching a particular language keyboard.

Regarding the problem I was facing about refreshing the list, it has been worked out in a very hacky manner for the moment. I will explain the problem better in the meeting tomorrow. The gist is that it works when we open the app on some other menu tab and then navigate to the `Settings` tab. This allows me to call the `viewWillAppear` method which takes care of the refresh. The refresh uses the Notification system. Publishes a notification whenever the value changes which is then handled by a function that is set to execute. This function calls the refresh on the child table views. 

I also tried to add a notification observer to only the dynamic data sections so that not all child tables are reloaded. This is done using an additional property `hasDynamicData` which accepts an enum value. Chose an enum since if we add more sections further that have dynamic data, handling it using a switch statement should be easier.

I plan on working on this in the background. But this issue was holding back from moving on to the next issues so I decided to push this unoptimised yet best working state. Do let me know if it is okay for now.

Hey @andrewtavis, 

PR adds the script for the English verbs. I don't think it's pretty at all. I just wrote some very verbose code that I think works. Could you please check? I am not sure I have covered all the cases. But for the keys we are querying currently, I think it might work. Let me know if there are any changes you want me to push.

The `all_conjugations` array hasn't been used actually. Left it there just in case we come back if there are any revisions to the query file or just in general have to work with formatting. Can remove if you think it isn't needed.
