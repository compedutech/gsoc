1357811301,main_view: Use one styling for compose and unread banner.,"<!-- Describe your pull request here.-->
Previously, we have duplicate stylings in compose banner and unread banner.
This is rather messy and creates a lot of styling rules. We should define
an abstraction for them. These changes will unite the stylings for the two 
banners into one, removing an excess of styling rules.

Fixes: #25717.

1473159167,"navbar_alerts: Improve ""Complete the organization profile"" banner.","<!-- Describe your pull request here.-->
Currently, we are displaying the ""Complete the organization profile""
banner immediately after the organization was created. It's important to
strongly encourage orgs to configure their profile, so we should delay
showing the banner if the profile has not been configured after 15 days.
Thus also allows the users to check out Zulip and see how it works before
configuring the organization settings.

Previously, the reason to complete the organization profile on the banner
wasn't clear and at times confusing. With the updated wording, it clears
up the confusion and improves the explaination of ""why"" as well.

Fixes: #24122.

1319004283,dev_settings: Remove THUMBNAIL_IMAGES from dev_settings.,"`THUMBNAIL_IMAGES` was previously set to true as there were tests on a new thumbnail functionality. The feature was never stable enough to remain in the codebase and was left enabled. This setting also doesn't reflect how the production deployments are and it is in our best interest to turn it off.

`THUMBNAIL_IMAGES` has been removed from:
`zproject/dev_settings.py`
`zproject/test_extra_settings.py`

**Note:**
Since the removal of `THUMBNAIL_IMAGES` in `test_extra_settings`, there was some coverage lost in `zerver/lib/markdown/__init__.py`. To prevent this, I reordered the checks at the call site to ensure that the function that lost coverage is tested.

1556586225,compose: Automatically change @ mentions to silent mentions in 1:1 DMs.,"It is common for users in other chat tools to start off a direct message
with @ mentioning the addressee. However, this results in potentially
unexpected behavior in Zulip, where the message is highlighted and shows
up in @ mentions in addition to DMs. We want to prevent this behaviour by
automatically changing the @ mentions to silent @ mentions for the user.

Fixes: #17998.

This is caused by both clipboard icon using the same Clipboard instance where the success event would only display the tooltip at the Zulip version. These changes fixes this and allows the clipboards to be independent of each other.

In https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/22524, we have updated the compose banner to the new, updated design
while the unread banners have remained the same. When comparing them side
by side, they look rather old and outdated. We should apply the updated
design to the unread banners as well.

1341340613,bootstrap: Remove unused stylings for `btn-info`.,"Currently, we are in the process of removing bootstrap out of the current Zulip codebase. A quick git grep on btn-info shows that the class is only used in `templates/corporate/billing.html` and a couple unread banners in `web/templates/unread_banner`. But it doesn't take advantage or use most of the styling rules that are set.

We should get rid of those rules as it's not being used and help simplify the process in removing bootstrap.
