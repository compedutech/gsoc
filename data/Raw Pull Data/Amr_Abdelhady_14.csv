- Fixed app crash when trying to download a patient from the server and quickly navigate out of the `lastviewedpatients` screen
- Changed **Add Patients** menu item in Synced Patients screen to **Download Patients** to better understand that this button navigates them to lastviewedpatients (and download patients from the _server_) screen, _not locally_.
- Added a `Toast` message that appears to the user when lastviewedpatients screen starts. With no patients viewed at first, the user may _falsely_ think that there is no patient list to search from. Instead, now the toast tells the user to use the search button to search for patients.
