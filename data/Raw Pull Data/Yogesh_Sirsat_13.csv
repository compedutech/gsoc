Reimplement bootstrap table-bordered CSS which we currently use
for zulip-web to `app_components.css` and remove that CSS from

**Remove table and table-striped class from help center tables.**
We don't need `.table` and `.table-striped` class anymore on
help center pages as we direct applying CSS on `table` tag from
`markdown.css`.

Moving usable CSS of `.table` from `portico.css` to `mardown.css`.

**Remove unused bootstrap table CSS.**
Remove CSS from `bootstrap.css` which we applied on `.table` but
have no use of them currently.

**Remove unneeded CSS from table-bordered class.**

882849417,popovers: Design changes for user profile popover.,"Almost all design changes ideas are from the discussion on CZO,
""design > pronouns in profile card"" for more information.

Move the local time just below the status if present else into that 
the same status block regardless of whether the status is set.

Move the management commands ""Mute this user"" and ""Manage this user""
into a three-dot menu. The three dots would be in the upper right.

Implement a new popover for a three-dot menu.

Change the private message link icon.

And some small design changes.

855113358,compose: Disable send button while uploads are in progress.,"In `upload.js` there is already code for disabling send button while uploading(works for saving when we edit, but not for send),
when I inspect in chrome, `disabled` attr comes and goes for saving button but not in the case for send button and the reason behind it is, The function `check_overflow_text()` from `compose_validate.js` removes `disabled` attr when message text not
overflowing after overflowing error, I just added if condition to remove `disabled` attr only if the text was overflowing before.

Added some CSS on the button to look disabled.

""Add/Edit custom profile field"" forms into modals, status update
notifications about these forms will be displayed inside their modal.

Issue #21634 describes pretty much everything about these new changes.
- [x] At present, the UI for editing a custom profile field opens directly inside the table. This is confusing, especially if you have more than one open, which is possible. Instead, clicking the pencil icon should open a modal to edit the field. The modal heading can be ""Edit custom profile field"".
- [x] Similarly, the ""Add custom profile field"" form should be migrated to a modal as well. The field labels in the modal should be above (on a separate line) from the text boxes. The button to open the modal should be on the same line as the ""Custom profile fields"" table heading; we can try right-aligning it.

892292291,custom_profile_fields: Allow display in user profile popover.,"* Backend changes.

To allow `custom_profile_field` to display in user profile popover, added a new boolean field in its model class.

In `custom_profile_fields.py`, functions are edited as per conditions, like currently we can display max 2 `custom_profile_fields` except `LONG_TEXT` and `USER` type fields.

The default custom profile field is now updatable but for only the ""display_in_profile_summary"" field.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Frontend settings changes.

Custom profile fields table `CSS` changed to fit the new ""Display"" column of editable checkboxes, checkboxes are for select/deselect custom profile field to display in profile popover.

New option ""Display in profile summary"" added in create and edit custom profile fields form, with the help of this the user can pick max of 2 custom profile fields except for `LONG_TEXT` and `USER` fields to be displayed in his user profile popover.

Checkboxes will go in a disabled state(Adding tooltip) except for selected when the max limit of displaying custom profile fields reaches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Frontend profile popover changes.

Displaying custom profile fields in user profile popover, as mentioned in the issue.

In `popovers.js` filtering out only those custom profile fields, which are not `LONG_TEXT` or `USER` fields and their values are not empty.

Custom profile fields rendering in profile popover the same way(code-wise) as in the user's full profile modal.

Using the custom profile field's name in lower case in the `fa` class, to get an icon of the external account.

`fa-{platform name}` this is the format of `fa` to fetch icon.
Created a new handlebar to convert a word into lower case.
