1400386413,Fixes DOM text reinterpreted as HTML vulnerability detected by CodeQL,"## Description
This fix creates jQuery objects for each HTML element and sets their attributes and text content separately, which ensures that no untrusted string can be interpreted as HTML. This way, even if inputId or $(this).text() are controlled by a user and contain malicious script, they will be treated as plain text and not executed as script which prevents injection attacks.

1400383836,Fixes Incomplete URL substring sanitization vulnerability detected by CodeQL,"## Description
The fix parse a URL before performing a check on its host value, and ensure that the check handles arbitrary subdomain sequences correctly.
- The statement `hostname === 'mifos.io'` will check if the hostname is exactly '[mifos.io](http://mifos.io/)'.
- The statement `domains.slice(-2).join('.') === 'mifos.io'` will check if the last two parts of the hostname (split by '.') are '[mifos.io](http://mifos.io/)'.
- Also, the updated code doesn't use `indexOf` anymore and therefore is not vulnerable to URL spoofing attacks that were possible with the original code.
- It uses the `endsWith` method to check if the hostname ends with '[mifos.io](http://mifos.io/)'.
