1409165603,PoC: TAP 19 - Add support for Content Addressable Systems like IPFS in TUF,"Fixes #2325 

**Description of the changes being introduced by the pull request**:
This PR is a part of [GSoC'23 Project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/vT5PhNL0). It introduces support for content addressable systems like IPFS in TUF. Detailed implementation document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFlzTUniBazcke1qCs6R84fu5RklwxKrT3tgtjfA16Q/edit?usp=sharing).

In order to test with an actual content addressable system, I have created a sample [repository](https://github.com/shubham4443/tuf-ipfs) which contains metadatas with an IPFS target. Simply run the following commands to download the target file.

```console
# initialize the client with Trust-On-First-Use
./client --url https://shubham4443.github.io/tuf-ipfs tofu

# Then download example file from the IPFS:
./client --url https://shubham4443.github.io/tuf-ipfs download ipfs:QmSFEbC6Y17cdti7damkjoqESWftkyfSXjdKDQqnf4ECV7
```
The PR is in draft status. `hashes` and `length` fields in `targets.json` are redundant in case of content addressable systems and needs to be removed.
