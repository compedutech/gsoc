1013088555,[GSoC] Migrated CollectionTask.AddNote to Coroutines,"## Purpose / Description
Migrated CollectionTask.AddNote to Coroutines

## Fixes
Fixes a part of #7108 

## Approach
Extracted the codes from AsyncTask callbacks, into a proper sequence of suspend function calls.

## How Has This Been Tested?
Passes the existing unit tests, runs as expected on realms 6i API 30

1038644468,[GSoC] Migrated CollectionTask.UpdateNote to Coroutines,"## Purpose / Description
Migrated CollectionTask.UpdateNote to Coroutines

## Fixes
A part of #7108

## Approach
- Moved the functionality of CollectionTask.UpdateNote to CollectionOperations.updateNote
- CardBrowser: Previous implementation of UpdateCardHandler starts a progressBar in onPreExecute, updates the card-list from onPostExecute and **closes the CardBrowser with RESULT_DB_ERROR** (not good way). The newer implementation handles progressBar using withProgress{}, updated the card after the process and Error is handled by LaunchCatchingTask which **properly shows the error message without abruptly closing the CardBrowser**.
- AbstractFlashcardViewer: Similar to CardBrowser, just there is set of operations that is being done onPostExecute which has been replicated into onCardUpdated function.

Replaced the usage of AsyncTask to create a chart with the suspend function. Since with coroutines we can easily switch context between the main and background thread, there is no need for a callback-based approach.

1062068783,[GSoC] Migrated CollectionTask.Flag to Coroutines,"* Post update flag behaviour has been taken up from FlagCardHandler which is just a subclass, without any additional implementations, of SuspendCardHandler.

* CollectionTask.Flag extends DismissNotes class which provides just a wrapper which allows Flag.actualTask to executeInTransaction. Same functionality has been combined and implemented in function updateSelectedCardsFlag.

IDK why the class is named DismissNotes, really not describes what it does.

Previous implementation of Flag was really messy and very hard to follow unless you've gone line by line code (took me enough time to understand). Currently it is single commit, and I couldn't figure out to break this commit into smaller ones. Will try though, if reviewing becomes harder.  I guess this migration makes it really easy to follow up what happens and where.

1079326853,[GSoC] Migrated CollectionTask.Reorder to Coroutines,"Since the launch is taking place from inside a AppCompatPreferenceActivity which is not a lifecycleOwner. And launchCatchingTask can only happen from a lifecycleOwner, so a custom CoroutineScope implementation is required which cancels any job (launched from this activity) when the activity gets destroyed and that is achieved by extending 'AppCompatPreferenceActivity: CoroutineScope by MainScope' and calling cancel in onDestroy.

MainScope delegates the CoroutineScope implementation with having Main dispatcher as default for launch{} calls. This is the reason why coroutine is launched using launch{} instead of launchCatchingTask{}
