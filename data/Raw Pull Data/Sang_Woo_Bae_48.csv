687356718,Persistent Networks Resources created on host during time of connecti…,"…on, and cleanup during time of removal

### Description


<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->
This PR is a GSoC project: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4814

This PR adds a feature to L2 persitent networks, where resources of the persistent networks are created at hostConnect phase of DefaultHostListener, and cleaned up at hostAboutToBeRemoved phase. 

<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->
<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->
This PR also fixes a bug, where rebooting the hosts removes the persistent network's resources, without readding them when the host is readded to the zone.

Fixes: #5196

### How Has This Been Tested?
This has been manually tested with a mbx KVM, XenServer and VmWare setup on a local machine. 

Different manual test scenarios:
1. When the persistent network is created and the host is added afterwards, the newly added host has the persistent network's resources.
2. When a host within a zone with a persistent network is removed from the zone, its resources will be cleaned up.
3. When a host with a running VM is removed from the zone, the running VM will migrate before the resources are cleaned up.
4. When a host is rebooted, it still has access to the persistent network's resources.

A Marvin component test under 
test/integration/component/test_persistent_networks.py
added that tests the following steps for a KVM environment.
1. identify hosts in the zone, and remove the first
2. create a L2 persistent network
3. add the host back to the zone

Validation steps:
1. Persistent network state should be implemented before adding the host
2. Host should be added back in successfully
3. Host should have the persistent networks resources after being added
