707390922,CATROID-834 Add Huawei face detection,"https://jira.catrob.at/browse/CATROID-834

This PR implements HMS Core ML Kit Face detection in place of Google ML Kit Face detection when a phone with Huawei Mobile Services is used. This functionality was tested manually as it is not yet possible to test this functionality automatically. The tests were done on a Huawei P40 and a OnePlus N10.

Because of changes made in https://jira.catrob.at/browse/CATROID-958 the coordinate translation 
is not the same as in the FaceAndTextDetector class and therefore the function was kept in the class.

677843532,CATROID-1035 FileNotFoundException when duplicate delete look in clone,"https://jira.catrob.at/browse/CATROID-1035

Deleting a look in a clone now only removes the look from the lookslist of the clone and doesn't delete the lookfile. 
When a look is deleted in an original sprite the look is also removed from the looklist and the lookfile is flagged and is deleted when the Stage lifecycle ends.
