#### 1) Implement following endpoints for Single Comment :
- Get a particular comment ( GET - `/api/v1/comment/comment_info/<int:issue_id>/<int:comment_id>`)
- Update comment ( PUT - `/api/v1/comment/comment_info/<int:issue_id>/<int:comment_id>`)
- Delete comment( DELETE - `/api/v1/comment/comment_info/<int:issue_id>/<int:comment_id>`)

Also made a minor change in create comment endpoint to also include thumbnail of the user (other than default) if user has uploaded one.

#### 2) Modified logs decorator to create logs for above endpoints. ( Though, i  think we do not need logs for updation/deletion of comments)

#### 3) Modify issue details route (GET) to also fetch the list of comments. Also modified projects serializer to include issues.
