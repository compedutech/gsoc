971374798,[GSoC] Fix sync button color,"## Purpose / Description
If user changed themes, the sync icon would use the same color of the sync category icon

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69634269/174460604-60f8fb7b-58ae-4641-9ccd-55e89a59fc40.png)


## Approach
Make sync icon inherit its color from `iconColor` attribute and set it to white on the top bar style.

More work could be done to untangle some icons from their colors and use styles to tint them instead of doing it programatically (e.g. on the reviewer app bar actions). I currently don't have time to untangle all the XMLs and icons, which should be a fair amount of work, but I particularly see it as an valid issue.

## Learning (optional, can help others)
TIL that setting the tint of an icon on code is a global change which will be shown if an activity is recreated.

987486828,[GSoC] Add a search bar to the settings screen,"## Pull Request template

## Purpose / Description
_Describe the problem or feature and motivation_

## Fixes
Fixes #8342

## Approach
- refactored some things to ease the search bar code
1. Add [SearchPreference](https://github.com/ByteHamster/SearchPreference) library
    - MIT licensed
    - I've contacted the author to question about the lack of updates for ~1 year:
        > Hi, Nice to hear that you want to integrate my library. There is not much development going on because it just works. It is integrated into AntennaPod and K-9 Mail and I have not heard of crashes or bugs there, so there is no need to commit anything :) If I get critical bug reports, I do plan to fix the problems. ByteHamster
     - edit: I had to send some PRs and they were accepted fairly quickly, so we can conclude that the mantainer is stil active
2. Implement the search bar
    - Add SearchPreferenceResultListener to the activty with the search bar
    - Add the search bar to the fragment which will hold it (HeaderFragment)
    - Configure the search index
        - Index the preferences XMLs
        - Ignore some preferences based on some conditions
        - Index the preferences that are created programatically (i.e. are not on a XML)
    - Set the resultClicked action
3. Add a test

998485957,[GSoC] Refactor preferences initialization,"~~On top of #11866. I should rebase once that is merged.~~

## Purpose / Description

Preferences initialization was a bit messy. Every screen ran [initAllPreferences](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/abd1f8bfc316cdf11aba51af7bda7f5b05c493d7/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/Preferences.kt#L205) and [initPreference](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/abd1f8bfc316cdf11aba51af7bda7f5b05c493d7/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/Preferences.kt#L225) multiple times, making things quite hard to follow. 

To keep things tidy, concise, and keep the preferences' configuration responsability on themselves and on their screens, I've done some refactors on the preferences activity

## Approach

1. Extract the preferences initialization to their screens on the `Init X preference individually` commits
- The required changes that escape the previous 2 patterns are marked on the commits as a `**` on the message beginning and are described as well

## How Has This Been Tested?

Manually opened/changed all preferences and it still works correctly. I should upload a video of it later.

998531875,[GSoC] Refactor preferences update,"Continuation of #11873

## Purpose / Description

Updating preferences was problematic, with [updatePreference](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/abd1f8bfc316cdf11aba51af7bda7f5b05c493d7/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/Preferences.kt#L438) being ran every time any preference is changed. Also, the preferences activity had the responsability of mananing methods of specific preferences, which isn't a good design (e.g. [this](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/abd1f8bfc316cdf11aba51af7bda7f5b05c493d7/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/Preferences.kt#L280))

To keep things tidy, concise, and keep the preferences' configuration responsability on themselves and on their screens, I've done some refactors on the preferences activity

## Approach

1. Extract the preferences update to their screens on the `Update X preference individually` commits
- The required changes that escape the previous patternare marked on the commits as a `**` on the message beginning and are described on their respective commit messages.

## How Has This Been Tested?

Manually opened/changed all preferences and it still works correctly. I should upload a video of it later.

1010090631,[GSoC] NF: Add a comment explaining setTargetFragment deprecation suppression,"## Purpose / Description
As I've commented on #9452:

Currently, the only place setTargetFragment is used is on Preferences.kt

It is necessary to use it, because AndroidX PreferenceDialogFragmentCompat calls getTargetFragment(). If this happens without setTargetFragment getting called before, it leads to a crash, which means that we can't exchange it to [setFragmentResultListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/fragment/app/FragmentManager#setFragmentResultListener(java.lang.String,androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner,androidx.fragment.app.FragmentResultListener)) as well.

This is definitely a upstream problem, and the current best course of action is to suppress the warning and give a +1 to these issues on Google issue tracker:

1010221625,[GSoC] Reorganize some preferences + refactors,"## Purpose / Description
~~On top of #11919~~

This is the last preferences reorganization PR I want to do for GSoC. Previously I'd thought about moving all the preferences from Advanced to the other screens, but after thinking a while, I've come to the conclusion that the it's best to keep it as a bucket of ""Things most users won't need or are really advanced, therefore they shouldn't dispute space with the relevant ones"".

As an example we have `Simple typed answer formatting`, only useful if typed answer is used AND the typed answer uses Polytonic Greek characters AND older webviews are being used (see #7901 if you are curious).

Other preferences there will be gone some day (e.g. `Replace newlines with HTML` when the visual editor is implemented). Others can be moved to the activities they impact (e.g. `Default deck when opening statistics` being moved to the statistics screen). And others need analytics (#11642) to evaluate if they can be discarded.

So, overall there isn't anything else I want to move right now.


## Approach
- Moved preferences:
    - `HTML/Javascript debug`: Advanced → Developer options
    - `Card browser` and `Anki card` context menus, and `Press back twite to go back/exit`: Advanced → General
    - `Card browser font scaling`: Appearance → Accessibility
- Removed `V2 scheduler` preference
    - 142f789a7bddaf46fbc4f9bd7e32defd3e4ae84d forces/requires/prompts to use the V2 scheduler when the user tries to study, so this preference is no longer necessary
- Build summaries for the remaining categories (General, Appearance and Advanced)
- Some cleanups around HeaderFragment.kt

## How Has This Been Tested?

Opened the app and opened the preferences categories to see if I get any crash

1018930880,[GSoC] Add `Use new backend` (persistent) preference,"## Purpose / Description
- The V16 pref is useful to testing in case the dev forgot to set `legacy_schema=false` on `local.properties` while not having to re-enable every time the app is reopened.

## Fixes
A tiny bit of #6772

## Approach
On the commits

## How Has This Been Tested?

1024338468,[GSoC] refactor: Migrate preferences formatted summaries configuration to the XMLs,"## Purpose / Description
It's better to keep the UI configuration as much as possible on the XMLs, so this is a step toward this goal.

## Approach
On the commits

## How Has This Been Tested?

Ran the app and saw if everything was the same way as before

## Learning (optional, can help others)
For some unknown reason (I've discovered by chance), getAttributeResourceValue only works for the custom namespace if ""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"" is set as namespace too.

Actually we should declare attributes on `attrs.xml` and get rid of the custom namespace everywhere. But I'm not doing this today (nor in the near future, as this envolves fixing DeckOptions and FilteredDeckOptions's prefs too)

Use style attributes the way Android intends to and simplify some preferences' constructors to improve Android Studio's layout previews

1. See if the summaries are looking right on Android Studio's layout previewer now that this is possible
2. Run the app and do the same thing on it 

## Learning (optional, can help others)
Android's documentation has its fair limits, so I went to the source code to see how they handled preferences internally

1026454293,[GSoC] Add a lint rule to use string resources for preferences keys + extract deck options/filtered deck options keys,"## Fixes
Fixes #10423

## Approach
For the key extractions, just used a regex to replace the strings for keys, searching for `android:(?:key|dependency)=""([^@].*?)""`. Deck options keys were replaced by `deck_options_KEYNAME_key` and filtered deck options were replaced by `filtered_deck_KEYNAME_key`. This way the change was easy to do and probably will be easy to review.

## How Has This Been Tested?

Ran lint and the unit tests created

1031404896,[GSoC] Implement the CSV importer,"## Purpose / Description
On top of #12072

## Fixes
Closes #6772
Closes #9437

## Approach

This implements the base for using upstream's HTML/Js pages directly on AnkiDroid.

I've used https://github.com/krmanik/Anki-Android/pull/23 as base of this PR. I wouldn't have managed to do it without all the previous work of Mani and Damien, so I thank them very much.

As discussed on https://github.com/krmanik/Anki-Android/pull/23, to use an Anki HTML page, we should be able to intercept POST requests. After some proof of concepts made by Mani, the conclusion was that hosting a local server, like the desktop application, may be most suitable approach.

To create the local server, I've used the same approach of https://github.com/krmanik/Anki-Android/pull/23 and added NanoHTTPD, a java server library, as dependency. I don't have experience with any Java server libraries, so I can't tell with confidence if this is *the best library*, but it seemed solid to me and already had a working model on Mani's PR, so using it looked like the best choice for the moment.

Besides the server, this PR implements the base classes for creating AnkiPages. Each page can easily extend `PageFragment` and define what it needs. I've tried using the new Statistics, Card Info, Deck Options pages and they work well. Try https://github.com/BrayanDSO/Anki-Android/tree/csvImporterOtherPages if you want to test them (the deck options screen may need some extra work).

Finally, the CSV importer page and its endpoints are implemented and can be used with the new backend.

**PENDING (for future PRs):**
- Close the Import dialog after the taps ""OK"" on the progress dialog
- Inject CSS to match the themes' colors
- ~~Maybe hide the file path with CSS/Js, because it may be big and there isn't much horizontal space in phone screens on portrait mode~~ (already on upstream)
- Not for my GSoC project, but the other screens could be implemented too, as they are mostly done, so other people could test/work on them as well

## How Has This Been Tested?

NOTICE: this needs an updated WebView (77+) to work correctly (see https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/6772#issuecomment-1209212058 and the comments below for discussion), which shouldn't be a problem as the project's minSdk (21) supports it. But if you are testing on a emulator, be aware that the WebView shipped on some older SDK versions may be an old version, so either update the WebView or use a newer SDK.

NOTICE 2: there may be a flickering issue after remapping fields, but that was already solved on upstream (https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/2005)

1. Enable the new backend (Settings > Advanced)
2. Deck picker > Three dot menu > Import > Text file
3. Select a CSV file (I've tested with Anking, pretty heavy and popular deck)
    - Here's a mini version (23KB) if anyone wants to test it: [MiniAnking.txt](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/files/9383917/MiniAnking.txt)
    - And here's a slightly cut version (GitHub only allows files up to 25MB): 
[Anking.txt](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/files/9383942/Anking.txt)
4. Configure anything on the CSV importer
5. Tap Import

1031918637,[GSoC] Add preference to allow/warn if using metered connections,"## Pull Request template

## Purpose / Description
Internet may be expensive 💵💰💲💸

## Fixes
Fixes #10706

## Approach
- Clean things a bit
- Create a ""Advanced"" category under ""Sync"", so things get a little more organized with the increasing number of preferences
- Add a preference to allow sync on metered connections (off by default)
     - If not allowed, auto sync under metered connections won't occur + the user will be warned if they trigger a manual sync under a metered connection
     - I'm quite open to string changes

## How Has This Been Tested?

## Purpose / Description
On the 2.3.0 version of SearchPreference, the visibility of SearchConfiguration is now protected instead of private.

This allows saving and setting the search bar configuration instead of recreating it every time the menu is recreated, which happens when any fragment is opened

And about the search history: It was disabled before because the saved entries weren't good (see https://github.com/ByteHamster/SearchPreference/issues/25)

- Index preferences programatically: as some are built programatically on AnkiDroid instead of on the XMLs
- Ignore preferences programatically: as some can't be used by everyone, e.g. newer API features and device specific settings (e.g. E-ink)

1031918637,[GSoC] Add preference to allow/warn if using metered connections,"## Pull Request template

## Purpose / Description
Internet may be expensive 💵💰💲💸

## Fixes
Fixes #10706

## Approach
- Clean things a bit
- Create a ""Advanced"" category under ""Sync"", so things get a little more organized with the increasing number of preferences
- Add a preference to allow sync on metered connections (off by default)
     - If not allowed, auto sync under metered connections won't occur + the user will be warned if they trigger a manual sync under a metered connection
     - I'm quite open to string changes

971374798,[GSoC] Fix sync button color,"## Purpose / Description
If user changed themes, the sync icon would use the same color of the sync category icon

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69634269/174460604-60f8fb7b-58ae-4641-9ccd-55e89a59fc40.png)


## Approach
Make sync icon inherit its color from `iconColor` attribute and set it to white on the top bar style.

More work could be done to untangle some icons from their colors and use styles to tint them instead of doing it programatically (e.g. on the reviewer app bar actions). I currently don't have time to untangle all the XMLs and icons, which should be a fair amount of work, but I particularly see it as an valid issue.

## Learning (optional, can help others)
TIL that setting the tint of an icon on code is a global change which will be shown if an activity is recreated.

For example, we can use a mock to check that if we click `clickLimit` time, the method to show the dialog is called.\r\n\r\nSame remarks applies to `setOnPreferenceChangeListener` above for example.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that this is not consistent with an important part of our current codebase.

1010221625,[GSoC] Reorganize some preferences + refactors,"## Purpose / Description
~~On top of #11919~~

This is the last preferences reorganization PR I want to do for GSoC. Previously I'd thought about moving all the preferences from Advanced to the other screens, but after thinking a while, I've come to the conclusion that the it's best to keep it as a bucket of ""Things most users won't need or are really advanced, therefore they shouldn't dispute space with the relevant ones"".

As an example we have `Simple typed answer formatting`, only useful if typed answer is used AND the typed answer uses Polytonic Greek characters AND older webviews are being used (see #7901 if you are curious).

Other preferences there will be gone some day (e.g. `Replace newlines with HTML` when the visual editor is implemented). Others can be moved to the activities they impact (e.g. `Default deck when opening statistics` being moved to the statistics screen). And others need analytics (#11642) to evaluate if they can be discarded.

So, overall there isn't anything else I want to move right now.


## Approach
- Moved preferences:
    - `HTML/Javascript debug`: Advanced → Developer options
    - `Card browser` and `Anki card` context menus, and `Press back twite to go back/exit`: Advanced → General
    - `Card browser font scaling`: Appearance → Accessibility
- Removed `V2 scheduler` preference
    - 142f789a7bddaf46fbc4f9bd7e32defd3e4ae84d forces/requires/prompts to use the V2 scheduler when the user tries to study, so this preference is no longer necessary
- Build summaries for the remaining categories (General, Appearance and Advanced)
- Some cleanups around HeaderFragment.kt

## How Has This Been Tested?

Opened the app and opened the preferences categories to see if I get any crash

1026454293,[GSoC] Add a lint rule to use string resources for preferences keys + extract deck options/filtered deck options keys,"## Fixes
Fixes #10423

## Approach
For the key extractions, just used a regex to replace the strings for keys, searching for `android:(?:key|dependency)=""([^@].*?)""`. Deck options keys were replaced by `deck_options_KEYNAME_key` and filtered deck options were replaced by `filtered_deck_KEYNAME_key`. This way the change was easy to do and probably will be easy to review.

## How Has This Been Tested?

Ran lint and the unit tests created

## Purpose / Description
_Describe the problem or feature and motivation_

## Fixes
Fixes #8342

## Approach
- refactored some things to ease the search bar code
1. Add [SearchPreference](https://github.com/ByteHamster/SearchPreference) library
    - MIT licensed
    - I've contacted the author to question about the lack of updates for ~1 year:
        > Hi, Nice to hear that you want to integrate my library. There is not much development going on because it just works. It is integrated into AntennaPod and K-9 Mail and I have not heard of crashes or bugs there, so there is no need to commit anything :) If I get critical bug reports, I do plan to fix the problems. ByteHamster
     - edit: I had to send some PRs and they were accepted fairly quickly, so we can conclude that the mantainer is stil active
2. Implement the search bar
    - Add SearchPreferenceResultListener to the activty with the search bar
    - Add the search bar to the fragment which will hold it (HeaderFragment)
    - Configure the search index
        - Index the preferences XMLs
        - Ignore some preferences based on some conditions
        - Index the preferences that are created programatically (i.e. are not on a XML)
    - Set the resultClicked action
3. Add a test

1045477748,[GSoC] Optimize preferences search bar configuration + enable search history,"## Pull Request template

## Purpose / Description
On the 2.3.0 version of SearchPreference, the visibility of SearchConfiguration is now protected instead of private.

This allows saving and setting the search bar configuration instead of recreating it every time the menu is recreated, which happens when any fragment is opened

And about the search history: It was disabled before because the saved entries weren't good (see https://github.com/ByteHamster/SearchPreference/issues/25)

## Approach
On the commits

## How Has This Been Tested?

Settings > Tap the search icon > search something and tap an option > tap the search icon again > see the history

961898362,[GSoC] Refactor preferences action bar title configuration,"## Purpose / Description
DRY on preferences fragments titles and YAGNI on SpecificSettingsFragment.setTitle

## Approach
- Get the fragment title from the PreferenceScreen instead of setting them manually
- Add the corresponding titles to the fragments without a title
- Remove SpecificSettingsFragment.setTitle since it isn't necessary now, and I believe that is a YAGNI case

## How Has This Been Tested?

Emulator on SDK 25 (the video shows the actionbar getting updated on screen changes)

998485957,[GSoC] Refactor preferences initialization,"~~On top of #11866. I should rebase once that is merged.~~

## Purpose / Description

Preferences initialization was a bit messy. Every screen ran [initAllPreferences](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/abd1f8bfc316cdf11aba51af7bda7f5b05c493d7/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/Preferences.kt#L205) and [initPreference](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/abd1f8bfc316cdf11aba51af7bda7f5b05c493d7/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/Preferences.kt#L225) multiple times, making things quite hard to follow. 

To keep things tidy, concise, and keep the preferences' configuration responsability on themselves and on their screens, I've done some refactors on the preferences activity

## Approach

1. Extract the preferences initialization to their screens on the `Init X preference individually` commits
- The required changes that escape the previous 2 patterns are marked on the commits as a `**` on the message beginning and are described as well

## How Has This Been Tested?

Manually opened/changed all preferences and it still works correctly. I should upload a video of it later.

998531875,[GSoC] Refactor preferences update,"Continuation of #11873

## Purpose / Description

Updating preferences was problematic, with [updatePreference](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/abd1f8bfc316cdf11aba51af7bda7f5b05c493d7/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/Preferences.kt#L438) being ran every time any preference is changed. Also, the preferences activity had the responsability of mananing methods of specific preferences, which isn't a good design (e.g. [this](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/blob/abd1f8bfc316cdf11aba51af7bda7f5b05c493d7/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/anki/Preferences.kt#L280))

To keep things tidy, concise, and keep the preferences' configuration responsability on themselves and on their screens, I've done some refactors on the preferences activity

## Approach

1. Extract the preferences update to their screens on the `Update X preference individually` commits
- The required changes that escape the previous patternare marked on the commits as a `**` on the message beginning and are described on their respective commit messages.

## How Has This Been Tested?

Manually opened/changed all preferences and it still works correctly. I should upload a video of it later.

1010090631,[GSoC] NF: Add a comment explaining setTargetFragment deprecation suppression,"## Purpose / Description
As I've commented on #9452:

Currently, the only place setTargetFragment is used is on Preferences.kt

It is necessary to use it, because AndroidX PreferenceDialogFragmentCompat calls getTargetFragment(). If this happens without setTargetFragment getting called before, it leads to a crash, which means that we can't exchange it to [setFragmentResultListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/fragment/app/FragmentManager#setFragmentResultListener(java.lang.String,androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner,androidx.fragment.app.FragmentResultListener)) as well.

This is definitely a upstream problem, and the current best course of action is to suppress the warning and give a +1 to these issues on Google issue tracker:

1024338468,[GSoC] refactor: Migrate preferences formatted summaries configuration to the XMLs,"## Purpose / Description
It's better to keep the UI configuration as much as possible on the XMLs, so this is a step toward this goal.

## Approach

## How Has This Been Tested?

## Learning (optional, can help others)
For some unknown reason (I've discovered by chance), getAttributeResourceValue only works for the custom namespace if ""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"" is set as namespace too.

Actually we should declare attributes on `attrs.xml` and get rid of the custom namespace everywhere. But I'm not doing this today (nor in the near future, as this envolves fixing DeckOptions and FilteredDeckOptions's prefs too)

1031404896,[GSoC] Implement the CSV importer,"## Purpose / Description
On top of #12072

## Fixes
Closes #6772
Closes #9437

## Approach

This implements the base for using upstream's HTML/Js pages directly on AnkiDroid.

I've used https://github.com/krmanik/Anki-Android/pull/23 as base of this PR. I wouldn't have managed to do it without all the previous work of Mani and Damien, so I thank them very much.

As discussed on https://github.com/krmanik/Anki-Android/pull/23, to use an Anki HTML page, we should be able to intercept POST requests. After some proof of concepts made by Mani, the conclusion was that hosting a local server, like the desktop application, may be most suitable approach.

To create the local server, I've used the same approach of https://github.com/krmanik/Anki-Android/pull/23 and added NanoHTTPD, a java server library, as dependency. I don't have experience with any Java server libraries, so I can't tell with confidence if this is *the best library*, but it seemed solid to me and already had a working model on Mani's PR, so using it looked like the best choice for the moment.

Besides the server, this PR implements the base classes for creating AnkiPages. Each page can easily extend `PageFragment` and define what it needs. I've tried using the new Statistics, Card Info, Deck Options pages and they work well. Try https://github.com/BrayanDSO/Anki-Android/tree/csvImporterOtherPages if you want to test them (the deck options screen may need some extra work).

Finally, the CSV importer page and its endpoints are implemented and can be used with the new backend.

**PENDING (for future PRs):**
- Close the Import dialog after the taps ""OK"" on the progress dialog
- Inject CSS to match the themes' colors
- ~~Maybe hide the file path with CSS/Js, because it may be big and there isn't much horizontal space in phone screens on portrait mode~~ (already on upstream)
- Not for my GSoC project, but the other screens could be implemented too, as they are mostly done, so other people could test/work on them as well

## How Has This Been Tested?

NOTICE: this needs an updated WebView (77+) to work correctly (see https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/6772#issuecomment-1209212058 and the comments below for discussion), which shouldn't be a problem as the project's minSdk (21) supports it. But if you are testing on a emulator, be aware that the WebView shipped on some older SDK versions may be an old version, so either update the WebView or use a newer SDK.

NOTICE 2: there may be a flickering issue after remapping fields, but that was already solved on upstream (https://github.com/ankitects/anki/pull/2005)

1. Enable the new backend (Settings > Advanced)
2. Deck picker > Three dot menu > Import > Text file
3. Select a CSV file (I've tested with Anking, pretty heavy and popular deck)
    - Here's a mini version (23KB) if anyone wants to test it: [MiniAnking.txt](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/files/9383917/MiniAnking.txt)
    - And here's a slightly cut version (GitHub only allows files up to 25MB): 
[Anking.txt](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/files/9383942/Anking.txt)
4. Configure anything on the CSV importer
5. Tap Import
