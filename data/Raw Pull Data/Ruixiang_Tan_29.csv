## Description
This pr adds JSON_INTERSECT(). This function can get the intersection between two jsons.
The behavior of intersection of different types is different. Taking the intersection of two objects is taking their common KV pairs. The intersection of array and array is to take their common elements. There is no intersection between scalar and object. An object and a scalar take an intersection with an array. As long as the object or scalar exists in the array, the intersection is the object or the scalar.
We put a json into the hash, scan another json, and efficiently get the intersection by reading and updating the hash information.
