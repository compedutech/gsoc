829589624,Fix erratic editing behavior,"This fixes the regression described at https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadroapp/issues/239. This issue appeared with https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/commit/d2dcfaead5080597c877246a7253c483f7668c3c, due to a small change in `avogadro/qtgui/rwmolecule_undo.h` wherein `RWMolecule::addAtom()` was made to be passed `m_atomId` rather than `m_atomUid`, when it should expect a UID.

The consequence was that, when two carbons were bonded and their hydrogens adjusted, the hydrogens on one of the carbons would be removed and not be added back, due to the passed UIDs actually being their IDs, which happened to be equal to the removed hydrogens' UIDs.

Then, trying to add atoms around this molecule with 5 atoms would pass atom ID 5 as UID, this being the UID of one of the existing hydrogens, which would simply get moved to the clicked location.

The issue fixed in this Pull Request is described at [this Debian package bug](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1005006). Simply, the Manipulation and Bond Centric Manipulation tools don't work.

The problem seems to arise from an Avogadro::Core::Molecule& being cast to a pointer and then stored. For some reason, this gives a different value as just using it in an expression without storing it first. I must admit I don't understand this, and it might be some special feature of the language I'm not aware of, or a compiler bug.

However, by the code one can deduce that both approaches should be expected to give the same result, so it's safe to simply replace the stored variable with an expression, and this workaround fully restores both tools.",True,825,https://api.github.com/repos/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/pulls/825,https://github.com/OpenChemistry/avogadrolibs/pull/825,closed,2,3,2,2,4,0,1,0,[{'name': 'bug'}],2022-02-23 01:45:41+00:00,2022-02-23 23:38:07+00:00,78746.0,21:52:26,[],"[{'commit_sha': '64f62a43067300890a86f7f58de8adc502e9eb96', 'committer_username': 'aerkiaga', 'committer_name': 'Aritz Erkiaga', 'committer_email': None, 'commit_date': datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 9, 20, 53, 5, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)}, {'commit_sha': '15fe8dfab976e3475ec2da22bc623f17c2217811', 'committer_username': 'aerkiaga', 'committer_name': 'Aritz Erkiaga', 'committer_email': None, 'commit_date': datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 9, 20, 53, 5, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)}]",Aritz Erkiaga,38228836,,User,,24,,6,8
874835693,Faster bond perception,"This Pull Requests implements a new bond perception algorithm that is O(n) in the average case, down from O(nÂ²). Among other probable improvements, this represents 5 - 15 times faster PDB import, making the Avogadro PDB path faster than Open Babel.

While the previous code tested every possible pair of atoms in a molecule, this new version first puts atoms in a 3D array of cubic bins with side equal to twice the maximum covalent radius plus tolerance, then only checks each atom against other atoms inside its bin and those in a 3D Moore neighborhood. For valid molecules, the number of operations performed must be, on average, linear to the number of atoms.

First of all, it implements reading them from CML, which also extends to other formats (e.g. SMILES, which is internally converted to CML). Those charges are then passed down the class hierarchy. Secondly, since PDB files can contain quaternary ammonium (e.g. acetylcholine, various drug ligands) or tertiary sulfonium (S-adenosylmethionine), or even quaternary arsonium (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5NXY) groups, and those cannot be eliminated by hydrogen adjustment, specific code was added to detect those.

Then, the code was made more convergent with other paths so as to allow the various optimization PRs to act on it.

916516341,Implement close contact perception logic,"This implements a new class, which moves the new binning logic from `perceiveBondsSimple` out of there and exposes it in a generic way. Possible uses include:
- Regular bond perception, which has already been updated to use the new code.
- Intermolecular force detection.
- Surface generation.

The new interface offers a few advantages:
- Does not assume anything about the data it's passed. Can be used for atoms or other data that can be represented as points in space.
- Is very fast. Time to construct an instance is O(n) to number of points, and time to get neighbors of some arbitrary point is O(n) to number of neighbors.
- Can handle any point as input, not necessarily the ones in the given set, or even within bounds.

The algorithm is simple: when a new atom is added, it's not assigned a subgraph quite yet. When two atoms are bonded, their subgraphs, if present, are merged. When a bond is broken, the subgraph it's in is marked dirty.

Now, when any information about subgraphs is queried, it will be returned if it refers to a clean subgraph. If it refers to a dirty subgraph, all its formed vertices are traversed and new subgraphs split from it. If it refers to a lone vertex, it will be assigned a subgraph.

This way, expensive operations are only performed once, or not at all, and any overhead is avoided.

I'm wondering if a `getNeighbors` (exclusive) would be welcome, as it would simply need to keep a copy of the input array and use it to decide what neighbors to actually return. The functions have also been made somewhat faster (at least 30%) and a new `getNeighborsInclusiveInPlace` has been added, which returns neighbors in an array passed as parameter rather than returning a newly allocated array, which could amount to many thousands of allocations.

965596550,Make use of angle tolerance for hole detection,"So, this PR implements some functionality that doesn't yet depend on `generateNewBondVector`. It computes the angle between the vector connecting both H-bonded atoms and the antipodes of all bond vectors to the pair acceptor (the 'holes'). If any of them produce an angle smaller than the specified tolerance, the bond is accepted.

As a consequence, only relatively ""real"" hydrogen bonds will be shown, which means that just adding hydrogens to an imported macromolecule will not produce as many of these bonds at random.

980366976,"Add ""Automatic"" resolution, smoothing pass UI, optimization","This PR adds:
* An ""Automatic"" resolution for surfaces, which chooses an appropriate resolution for the current molecule.
* A ""Smoothing Passes"" widget within the surfaces UI. Setting to zero passes disables smoothing and makes the operation faster.
* An optimization to the smoothing code: setting the maximum `NeighborPerceiver` distance to half its value. This makes it fast enough in most cases (still the main bottleneck), while constraining the largest mesh that can be smoothed without running into RAM limits (""typical"" proteins seem to run fine, but I can't process e.g. a whole ribosome). I plan on doing a more targeted optimization in the future, but this should allow actually using the new code for now.
