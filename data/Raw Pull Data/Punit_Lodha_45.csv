Process current packet as soon as the packet length is equal to the specified length. This leads to the packet being processed in the current FTS, instead of being processed in the next FTS, like before. Fixes #641 

Also ends up fixing #646, as the last packet is now processed instead of waiting for a next packet which never comes

This is causing the issue #677 again. Working on a fix for that
