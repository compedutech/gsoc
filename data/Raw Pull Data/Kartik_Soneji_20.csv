565496592,MDEV-12933: Sort out the compression library chaos,"Re-opens #1667 

This patch removes the compile-time dependency on compression libraries, and loads them during run time instead.
- The first commit creates a new switch for `mariadbd`/`mysqld` called `--use-compression=`, which allows the user to specify the libraries to be loaded on startup.  
- The next 6 commits add one service each. 
  In order: `LZMA`, `LZO`, `Snappy`, `BZip2`, `ZStd` and `LZ4`.  
- The next few commits contain workarounds that need to be fixed before merging.
  RocksDB has deeper integration with libraries than the other storage engines, so it needs access to more functions.
  The extra functions needed for RocksDB are in separate commits so that they can be removed easily if required.  
- The next commit adds tests.
- Finally, the last commit adds `sql/compression/README.md` that contains instructions to create a new compression service.
