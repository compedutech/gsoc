# Save Gif

resolves #5118 

This PR **resolves issue #5118**, in which a thorough discussion is had about whether p5.js should include a native GIF encoding solution or not. 

## How it works
In the previously mentioned issue some proposals were discussed about how the interface for this functionality should be. The easiest I found to both implement and use was the following. The `saveGif` function admits at most 3 arguments for now:

```javascript
saveGif(filename, duration, delay)
```

- `filename` for the name of the file downloaded to your computer
- `duration` duration **in seconds** that you wish to download from your animation
- `delay` delay **in seconds** that you wish to wait before recording the animation. The animation will nevertheless have a duration of what you specified on the `duration` argument.

As an example, I think it is best to use it within the mouse/keyboard events:
```javascript
 function mousePressed() {
   if (mouseButton === RIGHT) {
     saveGif('mySketch', 3, 1);
   }
 }
```

This function will take all the current frames of the present animation, save them in a buffer and then proceed to generate a palette, apply this palette to every frame, optimize for transparency and encode it in a GIF blob, that will then force to download.

Functionality can be extended in lots of places but I believe that the current state works very conveniently by adding just 3 extra lines of familiar code. I plan on keep contributing to this functionality even after the GSoC to make it as convenient as possible.

 ## Changes
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request and if possible provide links showcasing the changes. -->

1. Most important change is in [src/image/loading_displaying.js](https://github.com/jesi-rgb/p5.js/blob/ae03db0c62863387933f5dfd88ed3cb7dfbde411/src/image/loading_displaying.js), which is where the main `saveGif` function lives. Alongside this function, the functions `_generateGlobalPalette` and `_pixelEquals` were also added.
2. Second important change is in [src/image/image.js](https://github.com/jesi-rgb/p5.js/blob/73acfb183744179ea03a5f8f8e6bd1778205b6d7/src/image/image.js), where the old `saveGif` function was renamed to a more obscure and explicit `encodeAndDownloadGif`.
	1. Alongside this change, the file [src/image/p5.Image.js](https://github.com/jesi-rgb/p5.js/blob/73acfb183744179ea03a5f8f8e6bd1778205b6d7/src/image/p5.Image.js) was also changed to consider this new function name.
	2. Same goes with the test [test/unit/image/downloading.js](https://github.com/jesi-rgb/p5.js/blob/629d7448d4dc0cf562bc9214ab6cc76d04f5a680/test/unit/image/downloading.js), which was updated to evaluate the `encodeAndDownloadGif` function.

### ⚠ Some other changes
Some other changes were made for the sake of either speed or convenience. These changes are completely opinionated and may include breaking changes that I may not be aware of, so please consider them carefully. 

1. The `package.json` file is modified to include the package [gifenc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gifenc), created by [Matt DesLauriers](https://twitter.com/mattdesl). He personally reached out to me regarding this topic and it turns out that the package includes two key functions that make the GIF rendering not only much easier, but also much faster.
	1. Naturally, the `package-lock.json` file also changes.
2. The `Gruntfile.js` is also changed. In order to include Matt's package, we needed to first compile the javascript code to babel code, before _uglifying_ it. The uglify module wouldn't process the ES6 notation for some reason, although I've seen in some places that the project is already accounting for that. That is the `babel` module that appears in lines like `grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-babel');`
	1. Also, the `ecmaVersion` wouldn't pass the `npm run build` nor `npm run lint` nor any other command of this kind altogether. So I bumped up the version to 8 and it seems to be working fine.

Again, all these changes are considered from a rather ignorant and novel standpoint, so maybe I am making very questionable decisions here. I ask the community to pay special attention here, though it does not need to be said that I will try my best for this to be as close to perfect as it can be.
	
	


 ## Screenshots of the change:
<!-- If applicable, add screenshots depicting the changes. -->

These are some screenshots of the tool in use. We wrote the function keyPressed and we are tracking the 's' key. When pressed, a gif will be rendered and downloaded. A beautiful sketch by @TomasMiskov is presented.

During the saving and rendering, a little paragraph appears indicating the progress. I feel like this is very important since, even though it usually only takes a couple of seconds, a couple of seconds in web time is an almost infinite amount of time.

The current build pipeline takes all the code and runs `browserify` on it, which makes a single file, and that is passed on to `uglify`, which makes it very small, browser ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n`Uglify` does not understand ES6 code, so it needs to be transpiled before it gets here. This is `browserify\'s` (and more specifically,`babelify\'s`) job. `Browserify` can be coupled with babelify to transpile between javascript versions before compiling and bundling. \r\n\r\n# Babelify and options\r\nInside the `tasks/build/browserify.js` file we have, among other things, this important variable:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst babelifyOpts = {\r\n  // add some options\r\n  plugins: [\'static-fs\']\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich lets us modify the behaviour of `babelify`. As of right now, it only has a plugin called `static-fs`, which converts all asynchronous file system calls to their ""hardcoded"" version, statically inlining these calls.\r\n\r\nWe can pass in more options to change the behaviour:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst babelifyOpts = {\r\n  // add some options\r\n  plugins: [\'static-fs\'],\r\n  presets: [\'@babel/preset-env\'],\r\n  global: true,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis uses the `present-env` preset, recommended for our use case and the `global` option tells `babelify` to also process and transpile code coming from `node_modules`. The default behavior does not do that.\r\n\r\n# No solution found\r\n\r\nAfter playing with every combination, some problem arises.\r\n\r\n- If we don\'t include `global`, we cannot have `node_modules` transpiling so future dependencies from other contributors that also work similarly to `gifenc` won\'t work during build time.\r\n- If we don\'t include the `static-fs`, `mochaChrome` breaks:\r\n```javascript\r\nRunning ""mochaChrome:yui"" (mochaChrome) task\r\np5.js translator called before translations were loaded\r\np5.js translator called before translations were loaded\r\n[stuck here forever]\r\n```\r\n- Including `static-fs` AND `global` breaks the `static-fs` since it cannot compile other libraries (like `opentype`) with their file calls.\r\n```javascript\r\nFatal error: /Users/jesi/repositorios/p5.js/node_modules/opentype.js/dist/opentype.js: Not able to statically evaluate the expression(s) for babel-plugin-static-fs.\r\nTry changing your source code to something that can be evaluated at build-time, e.g.\r\n    const src = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + \'/foo.txt\', \'utf8\');\r\n while parsing file: /Users/jesi/repositorios/p5.js/node_modules/opentype.js/dist/opentype.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n# My initial solution\r\nInitially, I simply included the `grunt-babel` option since the main problem was I could not get `Uglify` to work. This worked fine immediately, albeit not knowing why and not knowing that `babelify` was already present.\r\n\r\nFor what it\'s worth, the `grunt-babel` has not given absolutely any problem, since it is set after the `browserify` task which means it gets to transpile the already bundled app. I believe this can open a door for future contributors that won\'t have to deal with this topic but just develop a better experience for p5.js.\r\n\r\nIf this is not enough to justify the `grunt-babel` inclusion, my only guess is that I should not include `gifenc` at all and figure out another way of using that code.
