- Choose the most frequently occuring palette as global palette, and use it wherever possible to avoid having a local palette for each frame.
- Slice the buffer at the end of the written GIF as actual filesize will almost always be less than the initial buffer size.
- Also reintroduces transparency wherever possible to reduce size further.


The sizes produced by 3 variants of saveGif(), taking the same 8.7 MB GIF as input:

- The one currently on master: 23 MB
- The one with the buffer sliced at the end and using global palettes wherever possible: 12.9 MB
- The one using transparency: 8.9 MB

In an effort to reduce the size of GIFs, I did increase the size of this function a lot :sweat_smile:

Resolves #4626 

Also fixed one more bug I came across along the way (  included in the list below )
 
### Changes:
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request and if possible provide links showcasing the changes. -->
- Simplify friendlyParamError messages to the format mentioned in #4626 .
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38867671/84445893-fb87af00-ac61-11ea-83ed-6aedab3e8ba7.png)

- Add internationalization support for `validateParameters` messages. 

- Remove `i18next`, `i18next-browser-languagedetector` and the translation json files from the minified build, reducing minified library size from 637 KB to 587 KB.
- Support incomplete translation files ( If a string is empty in a translation file, give the corresponding string from the default language file instead. ). Since the spanish translation file is incomplete, the translator used to return empty strings for some keys

   Now it defaults to the corresponding English version when it encounters an empty string

Resolves #4558 

Changes:
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request and if possible provide links showcasing the changes. -->
1. Store argument types to increase speed a bit and to prevent
   repetitive logging
2. Create new JSON file parameterData.json from data.json and
   use it for the FES instead so as to reduce library size

Running on the following sketch for testing on Chrome
```js
let iterations = 10000000;
function setup() {
  console.time('timer random');
  for(let i = 0; i<iterations; i++){
    random();
  }
  console.timeEnd('timer random');

  console.time('timer randomGaussian');
  for(let i = 0; i<iterations; i++){
    randomGaussian(10, 2);
  }
  console.timeEnd('timer randomGaussian');

  console.time('timer color');
  for(let i = 0; i<iterations; i++){
    color(10, 10, 10);
  }
  console.timeEnd('timer color');
  
}
```

Before
```
timer random: 693.552978515625ms
timer randomGaussian: 1639.44287109375ms
timer color: 4085.77392578125ms
```

After
```
timer random: 581.656982421875ms
timer randomGaussian: 1254.043212890625ms
timer color: 2215.990234375ms
```

I found that the performance improvement is only significant for functions with a lot of formats and overloads like `color()`.
However, this now prevents repetitive logging.
Earlier

Now
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38867671/82273570-6c0d1a00-999b-11ea-90fe-be64121c7739.png)


And the size of the compiled library now comes down to 3.5 MB. The source on master gives a final js file of size 4.7 MB

data.json is built by yui docs and it allows us to preprocess the data in preprocessor.js. But since data.json is used for generating the reference pages, I am leaving it untouched and creating another file parameterData.json. I am doing this bit in preprocessor.js but I am not sure if it is the correct place to do this. So until that is confirmed, I am keeping this PR as draft.

EDIT:
`int()` doesn't use validateParameters, my bad. Removing it from the above sketch.
`randomGaussian` doesn't use validateParameters directly but makes calls to `random()` within it. So a speedup of random speeds up `randomGaussian` too.

Quite a minor change but needed this for working on #4571 :sweat_smile: 

While we are at it, can I also update the example so that we select an element that exists in the reference tests ( perhaps `#mocha` or `head` or `body` instead of `beep` ) ?

Resolves #4583

 Changes:
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request and if possible provide links showcasing the changes. -->
The file `error_helpers.js` was growing too large, so as discussed in #4583, I have split it into 3 files inside a new folder `core/friendly_errors`

- validate_params.js
- file_errors.js
- fes_core.js

I also had to change the imports in other files to reflect this.

The blame history for the files is still retained as seen here:
- [validate_params.js](https://github.com/akshay-99/p5.js/blame/master/src/core/friendly_errors/validate_params.js)
- [file_errors.js](https://github.com/akshay-99/p5.js/blame/master/src/core/friendly_errors/file_errors.js)
- [fes_core.js](https://github.com/akshay-99/p5.js/blame/master/src/core/friendly_errors/fes_core.js)


Other than the splitting, this PR also:
- Adds stacktrace.js to parse the stack across browsers.
- Detects internal calls ( p5 function to p5 function ) and disable parameter validation for such calls.

Resolves #4571 

 Changes:
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request and if possible provide links showcasing the changes. -->
1. Make the FES detect trailing undefined arguments
Consider the following few examples
```js
let r, g, b;
function setup() {
  let r = 50;
  color(r, g, b);
}
```
Here g and b are undefined. But earlier as color with only one argument was still a valid overload, the FES did not log a message. But as it is passed 3 arguments, it is likely that them being undefined is unintentional and so a message should be displayed.

Now it shows:
`🌸 p5.js says: color() was expecting Number for parameter #1 (zero-based index), received an empty variable instead`

`🌸 p5.js says: color() was expecting Number for parameter #2 (zero-based index), received an empty variable instead
`

Similarly:
```js
function setup() {
  let a = document.getElementById('nonexistant');
  select('hgg', a);
}
```
would not have logged an error before this, as the undefined argument is trailing and select(string) is a valid overload. A message here is important to let the user know that `a` is empty ( i.e `notexistant` was not found )

Now it shows:
`🌸 p5.js says: select() was expecting String|p5.Element|HTMLElement for parameter #1 (zero-based index), received an empty variable instead.`

Also for
```js
let r;
circle(10, 10, r);
```
Earlier we used to get 
`🌸 p5.js says: circle() was expecting at least 3 arguments, but received only 2`

Now it correctly shows:
`🌸 p5.js says: circle() was expecting Number for parameter #2 (zero-based index), received an empty variable instead.`

2. Pass the error type to the ValidationError constructor so that it could be accessed in tests
3. Add tests for the edge cases in #2740 
4. Add tests for detection of trailing undefined arguments

 Changes:
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request and if possible provide links showcasing the changes. -->
In #4561, I replaced the use of `data.json` in favour of a new file, `parameterData.json`  but I forgot to configure browserify to ignore this file for the minified js. So I had accidentally increased the size of the minified library by about 200 KB :see_no_evil: .  This PR fixes that.

Also fixed one more bug I came across along the way (  included in the list below )
 
### Changes:
<!-- Add here what changes were made in this pull request and if possible provide links showcasing the changes. -->
- Simplify friendlyParamError messages to the format mentioned in #4626 .
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38867671/84445893-fb87af00-ac61-11ea-83ed-6aedab3e8ba7.png)

- Add internationalization support for `validateParameters` messages. 

- Remove `i18next`, `i18next-browser-languagedetector` and the translation json files from the minified build, reducing minified library size from 637 KB to 587 KB.
- Support incomplete translation files ( If a string is empty in a translation file, give the corresponding string from the default language file instead. ). Since the spanish translation file is incomplete, the translator used to return empty strings for some keys

Resolves #4637 

### Changes:
I have tried the simpler check using `toLowerCase()` as suggested by @limzykenneth .
Seems to work well to capture all kinds of mistakes in capitalization. For the sketch
```js
function Setup() {
  background(100);
}
```
and for the sketch
```js
let sketch = function(p) {
    p.Setup = () => {
        p.background(100);
    }
}
let myp5 = new p5(sketch);
```
We get
```
🌸 p5.js says: It seems that you may have accidently written Setup instead of setup.

Please correct it if it's not intentional. (http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/setup)
```

And for
```js
function setup() {
  createcanvas(400, 400);
  background(100);
}
```
We get
```
🌸 p5.js says: It seems that you may have accidently written createcanvas instead of createCanvas (at http://localhost:8000/lib/empty-example/sketch.js:2:5).

Please correct it to createCanvas if you wish to use the function from p5.js (http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createCanvas)
```

Performance-wise the only concern was `checkForUserDefinedFunctions` as it would have to run the check regardless of whether there is an actual error or not. But it seems to run in under a millisecond and it will run only once, after p5 is initialized. `fesErrorMonitor` shouldn't be a problem for performance as it only runs when we have an actual error.

This only captures capitalization mistakes.
I will try to capture the ones for spelling now and also add tests

### Update: 
Now works for spelling mistakes too. For
```js
function setup() {
  Colour();
}
```
```
🌸 p5.js says: It seems that you may have accidently written Colour instead of color (at http://localhost:8000/lib/empty-example/sketch.js:11:3).

Please correct it to color if you wish to use the function from p5.js (http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/color)
```

Also added a few tests

There may be unintentional errors that happen inside the p5js library. Often these are due to wrong arguments but may sometimes be due to other reasons. There are also a [bunch of intentional errors](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/search?l=JavaScript&p=2&q=throw+new+Error+path%3A%22src%2F%22) that the library can throw. These are often confusing as they point to a line inside the library and the stacktrace is filled with internal calls. These can be simplified by focusing on the lines in the sketch that led to it.  As seen above, the error from the browser can be confusing and the FES can quickly inform about the relevant details.

It may be good to consider using some styling ( colours, font, etc ) to pull the focus away from the raw error of the browser and towards the simpler FES message.

From what I could gather, styling of log messages used to be a part of the FES until it was removed three years ago in #2141, to integrate with the web editor, which was new back then. I assume that the console on editor did not support styling of messages back then. But I tried it now, and it seems to work. https://editor.p5js.org/akshay.padte/sketches/8VFX4Fq2v

It would great if someone could give some insight as to exactly why styling was removed in the FES and the current status with the web editor.

453531124,FES + i18n: Load translations from a CDN,"<!--
  Thank you for contributing! Please use this pull request (PR) template.

Resolves #4694

 Changes:
- [x] Publish translation files to a CDN with every release. I have set it up so that the contents under the path `translations/**` get published to NPM. From there, jsDelivr can cache it to their CDN.
I published a namespaced version to test this out and it seems to work
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@akshay-99/p5-test@1.0.1/translations/es/translation.json
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@akshay-99/p5-test@1.0.1/translations/en/translation.json

These changes would take effect from the next release. Before then, the configured path ( https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5/translations/ ) would give us a 404. This wouldn't be a problem for contributors because of the next point below.

- [x] Use local translation files in `dev` mode. Whenever someone is adding/updating something, they should be able to test it out. Fetching from the CDN will not be helpful as these changes wouldn't have been published yet. I configured grunt and browserify to pack all the translation files in the library when running `browserify:dev` ( i.e with `npm run dev` but not with `npm run build` )

Also, since we have updated our default branch name to `main`, we may have to change something with `np` to let it know this. Otherwise it complains that we aren't on the correct branch and would stop the release. For testing out this PR, I just manually passed in `--any-branch`. But there must be some other way to let `np` know the name of the default branch.

Addresses #4662 

### Changes:
There was an issue with global error catching in FES. Primarily the event listener for `unhandledrejection` failed to trigger in Chrome if the same-origin policy was not satisfied, or if the protocol used was `file:///` ( running p5 locally, without a local server ). This issue was due to a security policy in Chrome ( and maybe other similar browsers ) that would silently ignore the event listener if the origin of the event and the current origin didn't match. 

To fix this, the idea now is to enclose the calls to user-defined functions ( such as `setup`, `draw`, `preload`, `mouseClicked`, etc) in a `try-catch` block. Since these functions are called from the p5 core, the errors in them are propagated upwards and can be handled in a `catch` block. Once parsed and simplified by `fesErrorMonitor`, we again throw it upwards so that the original error too can appear on the console. The propagation of an error through the call stack is not affected by the security policy, even if different origins are involved ( probably because in this case it can only be seen by functions that directly led to the error )

This enclosing in a try-catch block is done by using a wrapper function `fesErrorWrapper` that wraps around a call to user-defined function from p5.

1. Update the FES documentation, both inline and contributor docs, to reflect recent changes. I also re-arranged a function and changed a few other small things to make things more readable. 

2. Added the problem mentioned in #4730 to Limitations. Thus this closes #4730

@stalgiag I think this is ready for review now.

- Add internationalization support for `validateParameters` messages. 

- Remove `i18next`, `i18next-browser-languagedetector` and the translation json files from the minified build, reducing minified library size from 637 KB to 587 KB.
- Support incomplete translation files ( If a string is empty in a translation file, give the corresponding string from the default language file instead. ). Since the spanish translation file is incomplete, the translator used to return empty strings for some keys

   Now it defaults to the corresponding English version when it encounters an empty string
