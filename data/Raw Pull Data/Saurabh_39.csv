## Description of what I changed

<!--- It can simply be your commit message, which you must have -->
First, these 3 issues are related to each other and the same classes (and lines of code) need to be changed, so I've combined them in one PR for not producing merge conflicts.
1. Fixed provider's name being _[givenName givenName]_ instead of _[givenName familyName]_ in server when reconnecting to the internet. [AC-968]
2. Fixed AddProviderWorker being called forever even after success. [AC-969]
3. Fixed failing to edit or delete a newly created Provider in both online and offline modes. [AC-970]
