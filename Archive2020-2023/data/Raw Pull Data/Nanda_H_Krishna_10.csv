Addresses #7027, aims to add a Formula DSL for `livecheck`.

Just starting to implement this and I have a few doubts. Where would the functions for `skip`, `using`, etc. mentioned in the example be defined? Or would they be implemented in some other way?

So far (locally) I have tried this, below the definition of `livecheck(&block)`:
```ruby
def skip(reason)
  puts ""Skipping: #{reason}""
end
```
However, I'm not sure if that's the way I should be doing it.",True,7179,https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/brew/pulls/7179,https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/7179,closed,193,0,5,1,43,18,1,0,[{'name': 'outdated'}],2020-03-15 20:16:02+00:00,2020-05-11 07:46:28+00:00,4879826.0,"56 days, 11:30:26","[{'comment_id': 414818577, 'comment_body': '```suggestion\r\n    def skip(skip_msg = nil)\r\n      @skipped = true\r\n      @skip_msg = skip_msg\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it would be simpler and more in keeping with other methods in `formula.rb` if `skip` simply set a `@skipped` instance variable to `true` (indicating that `skip` was present in the `livecheck` block in the formula) and set a `@skip_msg` instance variable to the provided message or `nil` by default.\r\n\r\nI think it\'s more appropriate to handle the output for the ""skipped"" text and printing `skip_msg` in  Homebrew/livecheck instead. The trouble is that we can only do that if we make `@skipped` and `@skip_msg` available to livecheck through public methods (e.g., `#skipped?` and `#skip_msg`). From my testing, this would seemingly also require adding `#skipped?` and `#skip_msg` methods to `extend/formula.rb` in Homebrew/livecheck (which simply call the class methods).\r\n\r\nThis bumps into the same issue I had before while working on the version-filtering feature, where livecheck\'s access is limited and we seemingly have to expose things that we may not want to expose in `formula.rb`.

Changes to the urls cop, related to the migration of Livecheckables to `livecheck` blocks in Homebrew/homebrew-core Formulae.

Summary:
* `archey-osx`: Shortened the whitelist prefix
* `apache` urls - skipped livecheck urls. Modifying the url to the suggested alternative did not work with livecheck, which currently uses `archive.apache.org` urls for the version heuristic.
* `sourceforge` urls - skipped livecheck urls. **Question:** The alternative suggested is `download.sourceforge.net/...`, however that redirects to just `sourceforge.net/...`; and while I've just disabled the check specifically for livecheck urls, should it be removed as there's a redirection anyway?

This PR aims to add completions for `livecheck`. So far, I've added the completion for `zsh`, and will be adding those for `bash` and `fish` soon.

The timing for this might seem weird but I've been carrying out `livecheck` for many formulae, and having completions would make it quite a bit easier for me than having to type out whole Formulae names 😅.

This PR integrates `livecheck` into Homebrew/brew as a developer command. It was almost just a copy-paste of files, but there were some style changes and a couple of minor differences as outlined by @samford. I've also brought over the command completions and placed them in the appropriate files (works on `zsh`, should also work on `bash` and `fish` based on my previous trials).

I tested this locally by also incorporating the changes in #8156 (without which we will get an `undefined method strategy` error), and it works as intended (I also untapped homebrew/livecheck).

Things to discuss:
1. What changes do we make to the livecheck code?
2. What tests do we write?
3. (Minor) Should livecheck be a common command (for completions)?

I will also be working on the RuboCops/audits in parallel.

I started by simply doing one execution per iteration, since this happens a minimum of once per formula (unless the formula is skipped).\r\n\r\nUsing `strategy.name.demodulize` is faster until we're calling it about 50 times per `livecheck` run. At 100 executions, the caching approach is around 1.5x faster. At 1000 executions, caching is 3x faster. At 5,000 executions (around once per homebrew/core formula), caching is 3.5x faster. However, caching the demodulized strategy names is primarily about minimizing memory allocations and that's where the difference is very notable.\r\n\r\nWith caching, we allocate a small amount of memory at the start of the livecheck run and that's it. Without caching, memory is allocated each time `strategy.name.demodulize` is executed. With 5,000 iterations and one execution each, this allocates over 270x more memory than the caching approach. With two executions, it's 540x more memory. With three executions it's 810x more memory, etc.\r\n\r\nThe speed difference reaches a point where it begins to level off  (e.g., going from 3.5x to 3.6x, etc.) but the difference in memory allocations is multiplied by the number of times `strategy.name.demodulize` is executed per iteration.\r\n\r\nWhen livecheck is run with the `--debug` or `--json --verbose` flags, `@livecheck_strategy_names` is used a minimum of two times per iteration. Otherwise, `@livecheck_strategy_names` is used once per iteration.\r\n\r\nFrom a speed perspective caching is beneficial above 50 executions and from a memory perspective it's beneficial above 18 executions. I do full homebrew-core runs using `--json --verbose` pretty regularly and this involves a minimum of 10,000 executions, for what it's worth.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more details but hopefully

Changes required by `livecheck`'s Formula URL reference feature.

Changes:
* `ivykis`: Appending a `/` to the `homepage` url for `livecheck` to use it
* `flawfinder`: It seems like the repository is now at https://github.com/david-a-wheeler/flawfinder.git and not the previous `head` URL, which doesn't show anything (for me at least).
* `mdds`: Adding a `.git` suffix to the `homepage` URL as `livecheck` requires it

I'm not sure if the web.archive.org URL for `homepage` was intentional, but their website seems to be up and I thought I'd change it. Came across this while adding a Livecheckable for this formula, and trying to use `:homepage`.
