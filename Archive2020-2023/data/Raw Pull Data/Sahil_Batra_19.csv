431399619,slack_import: Map slack owners to zulip owners.,"Slack owners and priamry owners will be mapped to zulip
realm owners on import.

Previously, we mapped the owner and primary owner roles of slack
to ROLE_REALM_ADMINISTRATOR in zulip. As we have added
ROLE_REALM_OWNER in 8bbc074, we now map slack owners and primary
owners to owners in zulip.

Tests are modified for checking all the 3 cases-
 - Slack workspace primary owner
 - Slack workspace owner
 - Slack workspace admin

This commit also has docs change in 'import_from_slack.md'.

streams.

Restriction was there to prevent user from creating a stream in which
the user cannot post himself but this will be taken care of with
stream admin feature.

Removed the tests as there is no restrciction now for creation of streams and users can create streams with all stream_post_policy values.

464206446,streams: Send PATCH request for stream name and description only when it is actually changed.,"<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->
This PR changes code to send patch request for stream name and description
only if their values are actually changed.

This also solves a bug where trying to save stream name from UI without actually
changing it returns 400 error. Ideally, it should not send request to API and should just
close the edit widget.

This PR changes the user popover for bot owner to be normal one instead of extended profile one.

This also has two prep commits-
1. Rename show_user_info_popover to show_sender_info_popover as this is used to show the user popover for message sender.
(A function named show_user_info_popover is added which is used for bot owners case and also will be used for 'invited_by' column in invites table.)
2.  Change the popover to show 'Reply mentioning user' option only in msg sender popover and not on popovers openend from right sidebar.

465071230,streams: Do not allow private default streams.,"<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->
- Do not allow private streams to be set as default.
- Do not allow default streams to be set as private.
- Added migration such that private default streams no longer remain default.

For default streams UI, we do not show private streams in typeahead itself and it shows error if someone types the stream name fully.
And while changing privacy of default streams, we show error in the modal itself. 

**Testing Plan:** <!-- How have you tested? --> Tested manually and also updated existing tests.

This PR fixes the bug where we hide the stream email and show empty container on live-update 
after unsubscribing and then we hide the complete email element after coming to unsubscribed
stream after changing streams in the settings page.

We now do not hide emails on live update after unsubscribing as we actually show stream emails for
unsubscribed streams.
