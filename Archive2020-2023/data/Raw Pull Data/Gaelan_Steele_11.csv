693284027,Initial vhost-user-scsi implementation,"Here's an initial implementation of vhost-user-scsi, as part of my GSoC project with @slp. Currently, it supports reading from up to 256 raw images.

For usage documentation and plans for future improvements, see [the README](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vhost-device/blob/da92bee292e1f4ba8683ee1288adeb0c67c04a65/src/scsi/README.md); for architectural documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vhost-device/blob/da92bee292e1f4ba8683ee1288adeb0c67c04a65/src/scsi/ARCHITECTURE.md) and comments in the code.

Although a read-only disk driver is of limited usefulness, I believe this code should be more-or-less production-ready. I've left some TODO comments in the code; these are either for features we'll want to add in the future, or places I want feedback from code reviewers (especially who are familiar with SCSI).",False,4,https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vhost-device/pulls/4,https://github.com/rust-vmm/vhost-device/pull/4,closed,4149,4,21,10,15,14,0,0,[],2021-07-20 08:51:46+00:00,2023-06-05 09:26:39+00:00,59186093.0,"685 days, 0:34:53","[{'comment_id': 763899155, 'comment_body': 'is this a duplicate?

683908101,Correct documentation of Address::unchecked_* methods.,"The ""unchecked"" arithmatic methods on the `Address` trait were documented to cause undefined behavior in the case of overflow or underflow. This is a strange claim; if that were truly the case, the methods should have been unsafe. It wasn't, though; every existing implementation of the trait used the `impl_address_ops!` macro, which just implements them with the standard Rust arithmatic operators, which follow this well-defined behavior:
 - In debug mode, overflow is checked for and results in a panic.
 - In release mode, overflow results in silent wrapping.

The wrapping behavior may be surprising or result in incorrect behavior, but it isn't undefined - we know exactly what will happen, and the optimizer is required to preserve that - so we shouldn't call it undefined.

It's also worth nothing that the names of these methods are a little confusing - the integer types in `std` have `unchecked_*` methods that actually invoke UB on overflow (and, accordingly, are unsafe). It might be worth renaming these methods to something more consistent with `std`'s naming. This is slightly complicated by the fact that `std` doesn't actually have a name for this behavior; it's just what the unqualified `+` operator or `.add()` method does. We may not want that, though, if we're trying to be more careful about overflow.

In any case, we don't have to know how it should work to document the current behavior.",True,156,https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pulls/156,https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory/pull/156,closed,15,3,1,1,2,0,0,0,[],2021-07-05 20:00:29+00:00,2021-07-14 11:23:42+00:00,746593.0,"8 days, 15:23:13",[],"[{'commit_sha': 'ba1ea125e8cc4b4b06f74f786fcca2daefe08673', 'committer_username': 'Gaelan', 'committer_name': 'Gaelan Steele', 'committer_email': 'gbs@canishe.com', 'commit_date': datetime.datetime(2013, 5, 22, 4, 38, 19, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)}]",Gaelan Steele,4495750,gbs@canishe.com,User,,162,,18,38

678661588,Minimally fix breakage from upstream changes.,"This PR does the minimum necessary to get things building after some breaking changes to the vm-virtio and vhost projects. There may be better ways to respond to some of these changes—I detail these below and in the commit messages—but this PR aims to get things compiling and working again in a simple and bikeshed-free way while we figure out an eventual solution.

In particular, this PR:

- Renames vm-virtio to virtio-queue (the former was split into several crates; everything we use is in virtio-queue).
- Converts our VhostUserSlaveReqHandlerMut to the new signatures, which use File instead of RawFd.

  In most cases, we were converting the RawFd into a File anyway, and  the new code is trivial. In a few cases, though, we actually want an  EventFd, which now requires this nasty construction:

  ```
  unsafe { EventFd::from_raw_fd(file.as_raw_fd())
  ```

  This is safe—EventFd::from_raw_fd is unsafe becuase it expects to  uniquely own its fd, an invariant File also has—but a little   inelegant.

  Ideally, we would either (a) change vmm-sys-util to provide a way to  safely create an EventFd from a File (this would be trivial; EventFd  actually stores its fd as a File internally), (b) pass around a  generic ""uniquely owned fd"" struct (like that propsed by Rust RFC)  #3128 instead of a File, or (c) change vhost to pass us an EventFd  instead of a File where appropriate (which, in practice, would mean  implementing (a) or (b) in vhost).
- ""Implements"" {get,set}_inflight_fd.

  This implementation just returns Err(InvalidOperation), which is the  correct response for a backend that hasn't negotiated the inflight  feature. Eventually, it'd be nice if we allowed the backend to  negotiate this feature; harshanavkis@8b44378 and slp@3346318 are two  attempts at this.
