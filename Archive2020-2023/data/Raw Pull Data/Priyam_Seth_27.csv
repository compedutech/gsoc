I have changed the way we were going to solve a bit. The highlighter feature was using a wrapper and I don't think it is good way to fake the highlight. Instead what this does it, it allows writing longer than MAX_LIMIT but also show the error above until, the length is more than the limit and removes it as it gets back in limit.

594398834,compose: Add support for full-screen compose box,"<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->
Fixes #17660

- [x] Adds a default max-height which will facilitate scrolling.
- [x] Add a expansion/collapsing button for toggling full-screen view.
- [x] Make the CSS needed for making textarea occupy full height.
- [x] Find a way to handle auto-resize properly.
- [x] Test properly for different use cases.
- [x] On the close of the compose box, it should be restored to its original width.
- [x] Add tests once we are ready that the intended behaviour is correct. (Also make the CI tests pass)

**Testing plan:** <!-- How have you tested? -->
Tested manually:
Open the compose box, toggle the height using the toggler button added just below the compose area.
To check autosize doesnot interfare is that when the compose height state is true, it is destroyed as this is the way to stop all the listeners added by it (check on docs of autosize) and particularly checked for changing messages and drafts while having full size compose box.
The save and copy also doesn't not have any problems as the autosize has been destroyed.
For node tests, I think for the compose_height file some basic tests needs to be defined.

<!-- What's this PR for?  (Just a link to an issue is fine.) -->


**Testing plan:** <!-- How have you tested? -->
Tested this manually right now. Here  I am adding some details on how to test:
1. Testing of locally echoed message -
Try to send a message first simply, it should have sent successfully and the message should not be in the drafts.
Now prepare another message,  and before sending it. In the developer tools -> network tab -> Make the network offline and then try sending the message. The message will get failed, and see the draft of that message will be in the drafts tab.
Now make the network again to no throttling in the network tab of developer tools. And retry sending the message, the message will be sent successfully and the draft will be deleted.

2. Testing of a non locally echoed message (eg. a message including an image)
The draft will not be saved for these messages and they remain in the compose box until the server gives a success signal for it. So, no need to save draft for these. Test by simply following the above procedure.

A gif of the above testing

<!-- Also be sure to make clear, coherent commits:

  -->
Some questions:
1. What if the user deletes the draft and resend the message successfully?
> Well in this case, the draft when doesn't exists. It does not matter, it also do not create any error.

2. If the user again opens the message from draft and tries to send it.
> This is also not creating any problem as it will not allow to locally echo the message in that case. It will allow when the network is good without locally echoing it. Also care is taken that no multiple drafts get created.

648308526,refactor: Create a color palette for Zulip.,"This commit tries to have certain css variable that will hold the general
most used colors of Zulip. They can be easily set at the top of the night
mode css file and this will reduce the overwriting of css properties.

One great feature of this PR that I liked is, if someone is designing something, it can happen that he just write the light theme css, and variables will automatically handle the color in dark theme.

For right now the first version of this task, I have created the following variables
```CSS
--color-background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--color-background-highlight: hsl(0, 0%, 88%);
--color-background-modal: hsl(0, 0%, 98%);
--color-placeholder: hsl(0, 0%, 45%);
--color-hotspot-before: hsl(0, 0%, 80%);
--color-text: hsl(0, 0%, 0%);
```
