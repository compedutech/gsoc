465069884,Spawns Igloos in Snow Biome,"The PR spawns igloos in the Snow Biome.
 Igloos are very rare and represent remaining traces of abandoned settlements in the Snow Biome.
This is the first example of using Structural Templates during WorldGen.

To Test: 
The Snow biome starts at height >= SeaLevel + 96 which is roughly equal to 1381~140 in y-coordinate.
Currently the igloos are set to have a very low probability of spawn, so it might be difficult to find one. I'd suggest enabling hspeed and flight and just traverse the snow biome and try to spot one. Following is an example of how it looks:

 In case it still can't be found, try changing line 64 in Igloo Provider:

466858953,Adds new method in AbstractValueModifiableEvent to obtain result value without capping,"Adds a new getResultValueWithoutCapping() method which returns result value without capping the negative values to zero. 
With this PR, the event shall support all values both positive and negative.
Formula for calculating the result value int the new getResultValueWithoutCapping() method would be:
>  result = (<baseValue> + Σ <modifier>) * Π <multiplier> + Σ <postModifier>

instead of the one in the original getResultValue() : 

> result = max(0, (<baseValue> + Σ <modifier>) * Π <multiplier> + Σ <postModifier>)

In short: This means the event now has two methods for calculating the result values:
> event.getResultValue()    // always positive
event.getResultValueWithoutCapping()  // can also be negative

Adds new allEffectModifier and level attributes to Hypo/HyperthermiaComponents, allEffectModifier directly impacts the magnitude of difficulty relating to each effect.
for e.g. an allEffectModifier = 2 value, increases the damage due to frostbite to double and decreases walkSpeedMultiplier to half in case of higher level of hyporthermia..

instead of the one in the original getResultValue() :

Currently the igloos are set to have a very low probability of spawn, so it might be difficult to find one. I'd suggest enabling hspeed and flight and just traverse the snow biome and try to spot one. Following is an example of how it looks:

The icons disable when the temperature returns to the normal body temperature range. 

This has been made as a first step to get rid of the chat log spamming method of keeping a track of body temperatures.
The PR currently uses dummy icons for the same which should later be updated after appropriate artwork.
As of now the chat log should not be removed because the environment temperatures vary unpredictably and it would be very difficult to attain a certain temperature in order to experience the various the various thermia effects in playtests, etc.
