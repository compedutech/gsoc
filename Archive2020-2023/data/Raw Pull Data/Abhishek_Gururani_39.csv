1277993339,fix : added apk support for arm64-v8a android architecture.,"
Fixes #1995 

Added application apk support for arm64-v8a android architecture, application now supports more devices(newer).

Current application apk didn't support the newer arm64-v8a android architecture, which is much recent and newer. According to the latest guidelines it's also required to be supported as it is a newer version of armeabi-v7a.

1. in build.gradle(app) -> abiFilters add ""arm64-v8a"" android architecture.
2. tested in my local device(armeabi-v7a) and pixel 2(arm64-v8a), application runs & installs succesfully.

1279148808,fix : fixed the logic of comparator function that's used to sort notifications,"Fixes #2000 


Fixed the logic of comparator function that used to sort nofications(desc order) on the basis of their timestamps.

The comparator function that is called in DatabaseHelper.kt to sort the notifications in Descending order of their timestamp is incorrect and doesn't provide the right comparator function logic to sort objects in descending order. According to online java/kotlin documentation a comparator function should provide return values for all three cases.

1. updated the comparator function to provide return values for all three conditions(a > b ,a < b and a == b), where a and b are timestamps of any two notifications that are being compared.

1281624893,fix : making on-screen/soft keyboard dismiss on background tap,"
Fixes #1499 

To enhance the user flow, added the ability to dismiss the soft keyboard or on-screen keyboard by tapping on the background or anywhere other than an EditText.

1. dismissSoftKeyboardOnBkgTap() takes View/ViewGroup as an input and then individually checks all its child Views/ViewGroups to find a View that doesn't include EditText.

2. when such a view is found and a tap is made on such a view, it's passed to hideSoftKeyboard() Utils function that by using Input Method Manager hides the soft keyboard.

3. tested on pixel 2(api 33), the fix works smoothly.
